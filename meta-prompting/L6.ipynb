       "## Best Routine\n",
       "Revised Routine Instructions (Improved for Accuracy v2)\n",
       "\n",
       "Golden Rules\n",
       "- Identity first: Do not take any action or disclose booking details until identity is verified via verify_identity (booking_reference, full_name, flight_number).\n",
       "- Internal data only: Never infer or guess fare type, refund amounts, fees, or eligibility. Always retrieve them using internal functions (check_ticket_type, check_fare_rules, check_compensation_eligibility, etc.).\n",
       "- Use exact customer-provided strings: When passing identifiers (e.g., medical_certificate IDs, bereavement docs) or new_flight codes to functions, use the exact string provided by the customer or returned by the internal function. Do not alter, rename, or substitute.\n",
       "- Explicit selection required for rebooking: Never choose a flight on the customer’s behalf. Present options and require explicit customer confirmation that includes the chosen flight code (e.g., “Yes, book LMG091”). Only then call the booking/rebooking function with that exact code.\n",
       "- Default to next-available flow for rebooking: When customer requests rebooking and has not provided a specific new_flight code, use check_next_available_flight first to present a concrete option. Use provide_alternative_options only if the customer asks to see more choices.\n",
       "- Weather cancellations and refunds: If the customer explicitly requests a refund after an airline weather cancellation, proceed directly with process_full_refund (skip rebooking). Otherwise, offer rebooking without fees first.\n",
       "- Final call sequencing: The last function call must be the primary resolution (e.g., process_partial_refund, offer_flight_credit, rebook_without_fee, process_change_no_fee, prioritize_missed_connections). Only call case_resolution after the customer confirms no further help is needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Confirm Identity\n",
       "   a. Prompt the customer to provide their booking reference, full name, and flight number. If any are missing, ask for the missing detail(s).\n",
       "   b. Call verify_identity with booking_reference, full_name, and flight_number.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Listen, Understand, and Route Using Special Triggers First\n",
       "   a. Identify the customer’s intent (cancel, change/rebook, compensation). If unclear, call ask_clarification with: \"Could you please specify if you would like to cancel your flight, make changes (rebook) to your booking, or inquire about compensation?\"\n",
       "   b. Special triggers (route these before generic flows):\n",
       "      - Missed connection due to airline delay: handle as Missed Connection Rebooking (Step 11a then Step 11e). Do not process compensation in the same turn; rebook first.\n",
       "      - Airline weather cancellation with rebooking request: go to Step 8.\n",
       "      - Airline cancellation causing overnight impact within 6 hours of departure with hotel request: go to Step 9b.\n",
       "      - Medical emergency: go to Step 13a; request medical certificate ID before proceeding.\n",
       "      - Bereavement: go to Step 13b; request documentation if needed.\n",
       "      - Group booking name change: go to Step 13c(ii).\n",
       "      - Request to change destination: go to Step 14c.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Check the Ticket Type\n",
       "   a. Call check_ticket_type with booking_reference to confirm non-refundable, refundable, or flexible, and any fare rule indicators.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Determine Request Type (after Step 2 routing)\n",
       "   a. If cancel: go to Step 5.\n",
       "   b. If change/rebook: go to Step 7.\n",
       "   c. If compensation (and no missed-connection trigger): go to Step 12.\n",
       "   d. If still unclear: call ask_clarification.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Handle Cancellations\n",
       "   a. If customer-initiated: go to Step 6.\n",
       "   b. If airline-initiated:\n",
       "      i. Weather-related: go to Step 8.\n",
       "      ii. Mechanical/operational: go to Step 9.\n",
       "      iii. Else: escalate the case.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Customer-Initiated Cancellations\n",
       "   a. If the ticket is refundable:\n",
       "      i. Ask: “Is your cancellation within 24 hours of booking?”\n",
       "         - If yes: call process_full_refund.\n",
       "         - If no or unknown: call check_fare_rules.\n",
       "           • If fare rules indicate partial_refund and provide a refund_amount, call process_partial_refund with booking_reference and the exact refund_amount returned. Do not round or modify the amount.\n",
       "           • If fare rules indicate full_refund, call process_full_refund.\n",
       "      ii. Do not call process_full_refund unless either within 24 hours or check_fare_rules indicates full_refund.\n",
       "   b. If the ticket is non-refundable:\n",
       "      i. Call offer_flight_credit.\n",
       "      ii. Inform the customer about any applicable penalty fees.\n",
       "   c. Optional: Inform the customer of refund timelines (7–10 business days for credit cards; 14–20 for debit cards) after initiating a refund.\n",
       "   d. Ask if there is anything more you can assist with. Only call case_resolution after the customer confirms no further assistance is needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Handle Changes (High-Level)\n",
       "   a. If the change is customer-initiated, proceed to Step 10.\n",
       "   b. If the change is an airline-initiated schedule change:\n",
       "      i. Minor (<2 hours): inform the customer of the new schedule and, if requested, call provide_alternative_options.\n",
       "      ii. Major (2+ hours): offer to rebook by calling rebook_without_fee, or offer a full refund by calling process_full_refund, or offer travel credit by calling offer_flight_credit.\n",
       "   c. Else: escalate the case.\n",

       "'Revised Routine Instructions (Improved for Accuracy v2)\\n\\nGolden Rules\\n- Identity first: Do not take any action or disclose booking details until identity is verified via verify_identity (booking_reference, full_name, flight_number).\\n- Internal data only: Never infer or guess fare type, refund amounts, fees, or eligibility. Always retrieve them using internal functions (check_ticket_type, check_fare_rules, check_compensation_eligibility, etc.).\\n- Use exact customer-provided strings: When passing identifiers (e.g., medical_certificate IDs, bereavement docs) or new_flight codes to functions, use the exact string provided by the customer or returned by the internal function. Do not alter, rename, or substitute.\\n- Explicit selection required for rebooking: Never choose a flight on the customer’s behalf. Present options and require explicit customer confirmation that includes the chosen flight code (e.g., “Yes, book LMG091”). Only then call the booking/rebooking function with that exact code.\\n- Default to next-available flow for rebooking: When customer requests rebooking and has not provided a specific new_flight code, use check_next_available_flight first to present a concrete option. Use provide_alternative_options only if the customer asks to see more choices.\\n- Weather cancellations and refunds: If the customer explicitly requests a refund after an airline weather cancellation, proceed directly with process_full_refund (skip rebooking). Otherwise, offer rebooking without fees first.\\n- Final call sequencing: The last function call must be the primary resolution (e.g., process_partial_refund, offer_flight_credit, rebook_without_fee, process_change_no_fee, prioritize_missed_connections). Only call case_resolution after the customer confirms no further help is needed.\\n\\n1. Confirm Identity\\n   a. Prompt the customer to provide their booking reference, full name, and flight number. If any are missing, ask for the missing detail(s).\\n   b. Call verify_identity with booking_reference, full_name, and flight_number.\\n\\n2. Listen, Understand, and Route Using Special Triggers First\\n   a. Identify the customer’s intent (cancel, change/rebook, compensation). If unclear, call ask_clarification with: \"Could you please specify if you would like to cancel your flight, make changes (rebook) to your booking, or inquire about compensation?\"\\n   b. Special triggers (route these before generic flows):\\n      - Missed connection due to airline delay: handle as Missed Connection Rebooking (Step 11a then Step 11e). Do not process compensation in the same turn; rebook first.\\n      - Airline weather cancellation with rebooking request: go to Step 8.\\n      - Airline cancellation causing overnight impact within 6 hours of departure with hotel request: go to Step 9b.\\n      - Medical emergency: go to Step 13a; request medical certificate ID before proceeding.\\n      - Bereavement: go to Step 13b; request documentation if needed.\\n      - Group booking name change: go to Step 13c(ii).\\n      - Request to change destination: go to Step 14c.\\n\\n3. Check the Ticket Type\\n   a. Call check_ticket_type with booking_reference to confirm non-refundable, refundable, or flexible, and any fare rule indicators.\\n\\n4. Determine Request Type (after Step 2 routing)\\n   a. If cancel: go to Step 5.\\n   b. If change/rebook: go to Step 7.\\n   c. If compensation (and no missed-connection trigger): go to Step 12.\\n   d. If still unclear: call ask_clarification.\\n\\n5. Handle Cancellations\\n   a. If customer-initiated: go to Step 6.\\n   b. If airline-initiated:\\n      i. Weather-related: go to Step 8.\\n      ii. Mechanical/operational: go to Step 9.\\n      iii. Else: escalate the case.\\n\\n6. Customer-Initiated Cancellations\\n   a. If the ticket is refundable:\\n      i. Ask: “Is your cancellation within 24 hours of booking?”\\n         - If yes: call process_full_refund.\\n         - If no or unknown: call check_fare_rules.\\n           • If fare rules indicate partial_refund and provide a refund_amount, call process_partial_refund with booking_reference and the exact refund_amount returned. Do not round or modify the amount.\\n           • If fare rules indicate full_refund, call process_full_refund.\\n      ii. Do not call process_full_refund unless either within 24 hours or check_fare_rules indicates full_refund.\\n   b. If the ticket is non-refundable:\\n      i. Call offer_flight_credit.\\n      ii. Inform the customer about any applicable penalty fees.\\n   c. Optional: Inform the customer of refund timelines (7–10 business days for credit cards; 14–20 for debit cards) after initiating a refund.\\n   d. Ask if there is anything more you can assist with. Only call case_resolution after the customer confirms no further assistance is needed.\\n\\n7. Handle Changes (High-Level)\\n   a. If the change is customer-initiated, proceed to Step 10.\\n   b. If the change is an airline-initiated schedule change:\\n      i. Minor (<2 hours): inform the customer of the new schedule and, if requested, call provide_alternative_options.\\n      ii. Major (2+ hours): offer to rebook by calling rebook_without_fee, or offer a full refund by calling process_full_refund, or offer travel credit by calling offer_flight_credit.\\n   c. Else: escalate the case.\\n\\n8. Weather-Related Airline-Initiated Cancellations\\n   a. If the customer requests rebooking: call rebook_without_fee to rebook on the next available flight without charges.\\n   b. If the customer explicitly requests a refund (rebooking not acceptable): call process_full_refund.\\n   c. Ask if there is anything more you can assist with. Only call case_resolution after the customer confirms no further assistance is needed.\\n\\n9. Mechanical Issues/Operational Changes Airline-Initiated Cancellations\\n   a. Call prioritize_missed_connections to give priority for rebooking.\\n   b.
