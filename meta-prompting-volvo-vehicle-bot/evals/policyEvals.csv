If the cable shows signs of damage, do not use it and contact an authorized Volvo workshop.\n2. **Charging Status Indicators**: Check the LED signals on the charging port. A solid white light indicates that the cable is connected but the car is not charging. If you see a red light, it indicates a charging fault, and you should check the display for additional information.\n3. **Releasing the Charging Cable**: If the charging cable does not release after stopping the charge, ensure the key is within range and the car is unlocked. You can try to stop charging via the display or by wiggling the charging cable. If it still does not release, lock and unlock the car, and wait for the LED on the charging port to turn off before trying again.\n4. **Contact Support**: If the problem persists, it is recommended to contact an authorized Volvo workshop for further assistance."" }"
